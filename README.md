# README: YOLOv4 Implementation and Training

## üìå **Project Overview**

This project focuses on implementing YOLOv4 using PyTorch. It involves:

1. **Inference** (Part I) - Mapping the YOLOv4 configuration file (`yolov4.cfg`) to PyTorch modules.
2. **Training** (Part II) - Training YOLOv4 on the COCO dataset, computing mAP, and implementing CIoU loss.

The model was modified to support **Mish activation**, **maxpool layers**, and **route layers** to concatenate multiple feature maps.

## ‚úÖ **Part I: Inference Implementation**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Implementing the Mish Activation Function**

Mish is an activation function introduced in YOLOv4 to improve gradient flow. Below is the code implemented in `mish.py`:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

def mish(x):
    return x * torch.tanh(F.softplus(x))

class Mish(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        return mish(x)
```

üîπ **This function was integrated into `darknet_test.py` for convolutional layers that use Mish activation.**

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Adding MaxPool Support in `create_modules()`**

YOLOv4 uses maxpool layers for downsampling. In `darknet_test.py`, I modified `create_modules()` to include maxpool layers:

```python
elif x["type"] == "maxpool":
    kernel_size = int(x["size"])
    stride = int(x["stride"])
    maxpool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size, stride)
    module.add_module("maxpool_{0}".format(index), maxpool)
```

üîπ **This ensures that maxpool layers are correctly mapped to PyTorch.**

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Implementing Route Layers to Concatenate Multiple Feature Maps**

Route layers allow feature reuse by concatenating outputs from different layers. I fixed the route issue in `darknet_test.py`:

```python
elif module_type == "route":
    layers = module["layers"].split(',')
    layers = [int(a) if int(a) >= 0 else i + int(a) for a in layers]
    valid_layers = [outputs[l] for l in layers if l in outputs]
    x = torch.cat(valid_layers, 1)  # Concatenate feature maps
```

üîπ **This prevents skipping of route layers and correctly concatenates feature maps.**

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Loading Pretrained Weights**

The model loads pretrained weights provided by the authors. I implemented `load_weights()` in `darknet_test.py`:

```python
def load_weights(self, weightfile, backbone_only=False):
    fp = open(weightfile, "rb")
    header = np.fromfile(fp, dtype=np.int32, count=5)
    weights = np.fromfile(fp, dtype=np.float32)
    ptr = 0
    for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks[1:]):
        if block["type"] == "convolutional":
            model = self.module_list[i]
            batch_normalize = int(block.get("batch_normalize", 0))
            conv = model[0]
            if batch_normalize:
                bn = model[1]
                for param in [bn.bias, bn.weight, bn.running_mean, bn.running_var]:
                    num = param.numel()
                    param.data.copy_(torch.from_numpy(weights[ptr:ptr+num]).view_as(param))
                    ptr += num
            num = conv.weight.numel()
            conv.weight.data.copy_(torch.from_numpy(weights[ptr:ptr+num]).view_as(conv.weight))
            ptr += num
```

üîπ **This function correctly loads pretrained weights into the model.**

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Inference Pipeline**

The detection process was implemented in `detect.py`, which:

- Loads an image
- Runs it through the YOLOv4 model
- Displays detected objects

```python
import cv2
from darknet_test import MyDarknet

model = MyDarknet("cfg/yolov4.cfg")
model.load_weights("yolov4.weights")
image = cv2.imread("test.jpg")
detections = model(image)
cv2.imshow("Detection", detections)
```

**‚úÖ Part I successfully implemented!** üöÄ

## ‚úÖ Part II: Training Implementation

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Preparation using FiftyOne**

The dataset was downloaded using FiftyOne:

```python
import fiftyone as fo
import fiftyone.zoo as foz

dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("coco-2017", split="validation", dataset_dir="/home/jupyter-dsai-st124872/RTML/A2/coco-2017/", overwrite=True)
```

üîπ **Only the validation set was downloaded and later split into training and validation subsets.**

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Training Pipeline in `train.py` and `full_train_yolo4.py`**

- `train.py` contains the `train_model()` function, which implements the training loop, including:
  - Forward propagation
  - Loss computation (MSE loss for bounding boxes, CIoU loss for regression)
  - Backpropagation and weight updates

- `full_train_yolo4.py` extends `train.py` and includes:
  - Model loading
  - Dataset preparation
  - Training loop execution
  - Evaluation of mAP

```python
from train import train_model
from custom_coco import CustomCoco

train_model(model, optimizer, train_dataloader, device, img_size, n_epoch, ckpt_dir)
```

---

## üö® Challenges Faced

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Missing Images**

- The image `000000000139.jpg` was missing, which caused dataset errors.
- The missing image was manually added to prevent failures during training.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Fixing Route Layer Issues**

- Initially, route layers like `-2` and `-1,-7` were skipped due to parsing errors.
- Instead of skipping, negative indices were properly mapped to actual layers.
- Layers were concatenated correctly to maintain feature reuse.

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Resolving Feature Map Size Mismatch**

- Some convolutional layers expected 128 channels but received 64.
- The issue was caused by incorrect concatenation of feature maps.
- The solution ensured that route layers produced the correct number of channels before passing them to convolutional layers. However more debugging has to be done. 

---

### Route Layer Issues üõë

Layers like -2 and -1,-7 were not being parsed correctly.

‚úÖ **Solution:** Fixed negative indexing and ensured layers were not skipped.

---

### Feature Map Size Mismatch ‚ö†Ô∏è

Conv layers expected 128 channels but got 64.

‚úÖ **Solution:** Ensure correct concatenation in route layers.

- `custom_coco.py`
- `darknet_test.py`
